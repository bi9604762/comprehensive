## Asset Support Comparison

Among the four wallets, **Bitget Wallet** supports the most blockchains and allows for adding custom networks and testnet tokens, offering exceptional flexibility. **Coinbase Wallet**, while supporting fewer blockchains by default, also allows custom networks and testnets but limits supported address types to five: EVM, Solana, BTC, Dogecoin, and Litecoin. **Trust Wallet** and **OKX Wallet**, though unable to add custom networks or testnets, already support most popular blockchains in the market.

## User Experience Comparison

User experience can be divided into terminal support, features, and ease of use. Here's how the wallets perform:

### Platform Support
All four wallets support **iOS**, **Android**, and **Chrome**.

### Features
- **Bitget Wallet** leads in aggregated swap functionality, supporting the most blockchains.
- **OKX Wallet** and **Bitget Wallet** support **limit orders** on their on-chain swap protocols, offering benefits like:
  - **Increased efficiency**: Orders execute automatically when market conditions match user preferences, saving time.
  - **Better pricing**: Limit orders allow users to enter or exit positions at more favorable prices during volatile markets.
  - **Automated strategies**: Combining limit orders with automation features enables complex trading strategies.

While **Coinbase Wallet** and **Trust Wallet** lack native limit order features, **OKX Wallet** and **Bitget Wallet** also support cross-chain swaps, making cross-chain asset management easier.

However, **Coinbase Wallet** only supports cross-chain transactions between ETH and Polygon, and **Trust Wallet** does not support any form of cross-chain functionality.

## Fiat Exchange Options

- **Trust Wallet** and **Coinbase Wallet** excel in fiat-to-crypto conversion by integrating third-party payment providers for seamless purchases via credit cards.
- **OKX Wallet** and **Bitget Wallet** also support exchange-based fiat withdrawals, while **Bitget Wallet** allows one-click deposits through its contract features.

### Advanced Tools
- Both **OKX Wallet** and **Bitget Wallet** include on-chain analytics, enabling users to monitor liquidity pools and trading activity directly in their mobile apps. However, **Bitget Wallet** goes further with tools like K-line charts and 24-hour fund flow analysis.
- **Coinbase Wallet** and **Trust Wallet**, by contrast, only provide basic token price graphs, lacking on-chain insights.

## Security Comparison

### Physical Security
All wallets have solid physical security measures:
- **Trust Wallet**: Offers a high-security level by requiring password input for every app switch.
- **Coinbase Wallet** and **Bitget Wallet**: Include program locks and facial recognition options for convenience.
- **OKX Wallet**: Lacks a program lock, posing higher risks if a device is lost or compromised.

### Cloud Backup Risks
Features like **iCloud backup** for MPC functionality in **Coinbase Wallet**, **Trust Wallet**, and **OKX Wallet** may introduce additional risks if enabled. Users are advised to avoid activating this feature for enhanced safety.

### Contract Interaction Risks
- **Trust Wallet** and **OKX Wallet** provide risk alerts for malicious contracts and suspicious transactions, helping users prevent asset theft or loss.
- **Coinbase Wallet**, **OKX Wallet**, and **Bitget Wallet** allow users to revoke token authorizations post-interaction, reducing exposure to risk. **Bitget Wallet** further integrates a token contract analysis tool to detect high-risk tokens, aiding traders in avoiding scams.

### Operational Security
Despite robust features, operational security is a critical consideration:
- In 2022, **Bitget Wallet** faced an APK hijacking incident that led to asset losses for some users. However, Bitget compensated affected users and strengthened its security infrastructure. This highlights the importance of brand trust, incident response, and comprehensive safeguards when selecting a wallet.

## Final Thoughts

When choosing a wallet, users must weigh the features, flexibility, and security offered by each platform. **OKX Wallet** and **Bitget Wallet** stand out for their advanced tools, efficient cross-chain functionality, and trading automation features. However, operational security and ease of use remain crucial considerations.
