# How to Earn Stable Returns by Holding and Earning Crypto on OKX

---

## Introduction to Crypto Passive Income

Earning additional income through financial investments has become a common strategy. In the world of cryptocurrency, the concept of "holding and earning" is gaining traction. Similar to earning interest by depositing assets in a bank, holding digital assets allows you to earn passive income. This method is convenient, offers higher returns, and is ideal for users who already own cryptocurrencies but want to maximize their idle assets.

For beginners or those with moderate risk tolerance, earning passive income through digital currencies is an excellent choice. Instead of just holding your digital assets, why not put them to work and increase your returns?
