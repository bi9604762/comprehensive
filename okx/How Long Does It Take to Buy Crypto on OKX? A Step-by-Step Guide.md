## Key Notes When Buying Crypto on OKX

To ensure a smooth transaction, keep the following in mind:

1. **Avoid sensitive remarks:** Do not include cryptocurrency-related terms such as OKX, BTC, or Bitcoin in payment remarks to prevent delays or account issues.
2. **Large transfers outside business hours:** For transfers exceeding $5,000 during non-working hours (holidays or 5:00 PM to 8:00 AM on weekdays), itâ€™s advisable to split payments to avoid potential delays.
3. **Order cancellation:** You can cancel an order within 15 minutes of placement. However, frequent cancellations or repeated failures to complete payment may affect your accountâ€™s credibility and restrict further transactions for the day.

## OKX Fees Explained

### Zero Deposit Fees

Depositing funds into OKX is completely free. The platform does not charge for incoming transfers, whether they are from other platforms or your personal accounts.

### Withdrawal Fees

Withdrawal fees, also known as **Gas Fees**, are determined by blockchain network costs and are not collected by OKX. These fees reward miners for processing transactions on the blockchain. The formula for actual withdrawal amounts is:

**Net Received Amount = Withdrawal Amount - Withdrawal Fee**

> **Pro Tip:** You can adjust withdrawal fees manually. Higher fees incentivize miners to prioritize your transaction, reducing waiting time. Conversely, lower fees may result in longer delays. If time is not critical, selecting a lower fee option can save costs.

### Using Platform Tokens for Discounts

OKX offers **platform tokens** that can be used to offset withdrawal and transfer fees, making transactions more cost-effective. For regular users, this is a highly efficient way to save on fees.
