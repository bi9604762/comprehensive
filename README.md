# Comprehensive OKX Review: A Top Crypto Exchange in 2025

Cryptocurrency exchanges differ significantly from traditional brokerage firms, as they are not members of the [Securities Investor Protection Corp. (SIPC)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sipc.asp). This means that, unless explicitly stated in user terms, investors with assets held on custodial exchanges could lose their funds if classified as [unsecured creditors](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/unsecuredcreditor.asp).
